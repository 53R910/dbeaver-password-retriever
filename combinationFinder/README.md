# oneoffcodes

Accept an array of integer as input. If sum of any combination of numbers from that array is equal to the last element of the array, then return success

Examples
[1,2,5,7,10] => output: true

In this case the last element of the array is 10, hence the target Sum is 10. So if at least one combination exists whose sum is 10, it's a 'true'. Here we have one combination, 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 ==> return true
